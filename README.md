Agriculture-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
Project Objective

The aim of this project is to analyze climate patterns, crop health, soil quality, and farmer conditions using an integrated Power BI dashboard. This enables better agricultural planning, identification of risk factors, and data-driven decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.
